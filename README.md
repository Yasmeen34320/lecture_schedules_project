## 7 -
after you specify the details of your lecture, the system has a couple of `conditions` that must be agreed with your choices 
- `first`: the time you have chosen, it`s not selected before 
		note: the time here is the combination of three things (number of grades + the day + the period) 
		, also we removed period three on Tuesday because it`s a Student Activity
                 always so you don`t have the choice to select it   
- `second`: it ensures that you didn`t select any professor with the same day, period again 
- `third`: it ensures that you didn`t select any room with the same day, period again 
## 8 -

On the page details we also provide a simple table of every department by buttons that display all lectures created so you can edit or delete any of them
